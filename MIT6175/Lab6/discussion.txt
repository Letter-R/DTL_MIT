Q1
after "sw" instruction, 
			//when the instruction that caused the misdirection is a store, the memory address for the store is set as next pc
			//unsuported instruction ensues...
            //
            //eInst.addr = (dInst.iType == Ld || dInst.iType == St) ? aluRes : brAddr;
maybe, break down eInst.addr into two attributes 
            
Q2
